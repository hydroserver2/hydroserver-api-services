  fields:
    code: '0'
    definition: Raw data
    explanation: >-
      Raw and unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone quality
      control. Depending on the variable, data type, and data transmission
      system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after the
      measurements have been made. Examples include real-time precipitation,
      streamflow, and water quality measurements.

  fields:
    code: '3'
    definition: Interpreted products
    explanation: >-
      Interpreted products that require researcher driven analysis and
      interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong
      prior assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from
      the combination of rain gauges and radar return data.

    definition: Knowledge products
    explanation: >-
      Knowledge products that require researcher driven scientific
      interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include
      model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior
      assumptions. An example is percentages of old or new water in a hydrograph
      inferred from an isotope analysis.

    definition: Quality controlled data
    explanation: >-
      Quality controlled data that have passed quality assurance procedures such
      as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual
      inspection and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published
      streamflow records following parsing through USGS quality control
      procedures.

    definition: Derived products
    explanation: >-
      Derived products that require scientific and technical interpretation and
      may include multiple-sensor data. An example is basin average
      precipitation derived from rain gauges using an interpolation procedure.
