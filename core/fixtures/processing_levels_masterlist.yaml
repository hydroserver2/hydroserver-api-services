  fields:
    definition: Raw data
    explanation:
      Raw and unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone
      quality control. Depending on the variable, data type, and data transmission
      system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after the measurements
      have been made. Examples include real-time precipitation, streamflow, and water
      quality measurements.

  fields:
    definition: Quality controlled data
    explanation:
      Quality controlled data that have passed quality assurance procedures
      such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection
      and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published streamflow records
      following parsing through USGS quality control procedures.

  fields:
    definition: Derived products
    explanation:
      Derived products that require scientific and technical interpretation
      and may include multiple-sensor data. An example is basin average precipitation
      derived from rain gauges using an interpolation procedure.

  fields:
    definition: Interpreted products
    explanation:
      Interpreted products that require researcher driven analysis and
      interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior
      assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from the combination
      of rain gauges and radar return data.

  fields:
    definition: Knowledge products
    explanation:
      Knowledge products that require researcher driven scientific interpretation
      and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation
      using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is percentages
      of old or new water in a hydrograph inferred from an isotope analysis.
